# kazakhstan_road_accident_dataset
This repository contains an educational dataset focused on road traffic accidents in Kazakhstan during 2024, prepared specifically for analytics and reporting practice. The goal is to support end-to-end workflows: data loading, cleaning, modeling, exploration, and visualization. The dataset structure is designed to be “BI-ready” for Power BI dashboards (time trends, regional breakdowns, severity distribution, top accident types, and interactive filters) and also suitable for Python-based analysis (EDA, aggregation, feature engineering, and basic predictive experiments).
Included materials aim to help students understand how real-world accident records are typically organized: event identifiers, date/time fields, location/region attributes, accident type and severity indicators, and counts related to vehicles and casualties. The repository may also include documentation of columns, recommended relationships between tables (if multiple tables are used), and example metrics used in road safety analytics projects. This dataset is intended for coursework, labs, and portfolio demonstrations in data analytics and information systems.
